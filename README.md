This document outlines the design of software and hardware for a eletrical power distribution system (EPS) used in "flatsat", a teaching aid simulating a cubesat, aimed for class-room use. This repository contains the telemetry, control, and interface software for this system.

The two main sections of this repo are the EDUSAT Web Application Code (in the folder "EDUSAT_App"), and the EDUSAT Telemetry code for MCU data collection (in the folder "EDUSAT_Telem").

## Installation and setup:
To set up this project:
1. Clone the git repository. Tutorial for basic git functions found [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-clone).
2. Install nodejs:  
    - [Windows or Mac OS X](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    - [Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04)
3. Install yarn. It is the prefered package manager, and can be installed via nodejs's npm. We use classic yarn (v1), but other versions should be compatible.
    - [All Operating Systems](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)
4. Run the EDUSAT.bat file. Two new command prompt windows will open up, as well as a webpage in your browser at *localhost:8085*. An EDUSAT.sh file for Linux based systems is being created, but has not been added to the git repository yet.
5. *NOTE*: If you close the command prompt windows, the GUI will no longer work. Keep them open.

EDUSAT's telemtry is visualized in a Web interface powered by Typescipt and Nodejs. Nodejs allows for Javascript and Typescript to be excuted outside of a browser, in this case it is neccesary as it allows for direct acces to the serial port to commuincate with the microcontroller gathering the telemetry.

### Contributing to this project
To make any changes to this project, knowledge of the software and libraries used to develop it will be required. Edits to the overall look of the code can be made by modifying the *index.html* and *style.css* files.

Edits to the look of specific features of the UI can be made by altering snippets of code contained within `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` braces found in the App.tsx file (`EDUSAT>EDUSAT_App>webpage>src>App.tsx`).

If any additional library dependencies are required, they can be added to the *package.json* manually, or with yarn by running the following command in the `EDUSAT>EDUSAT_App>webpage` folder:

```yarn add DEPENDENCY_NAME``` 

For more information about React (if you would like to use React to add more features), follow this [link](https://reactjs.org/).

Note the colours around each component:
+ RED = MPPT and system input (either through a solar panel or a PSU).
+ BLUE = Telemetry boards, the one on the left is full of current sensors and amplifiers. The one on the right has the voltage divider, MUX, and arduino. Headers are used to connect the current sensing board and temperature sensors to the MUX.
+ Green = DC-DC conversion and system output. The top board is the 9V buck-boost, then the 3V3 and 5V boards are mounted side by side on the telemetry board.
+ Yellow = A 800 mAH 2S 7.4V Lipo in a 3D printed mount and a extra board that serves as a junction between all the components.

On the MPPT and system input boards, there are three potentiometers. From top to bottom, these potentiometers correspond to VR2, VR3, and VR1 in the schematic.

## EDUSAT Software - Data Collection via Microcontroller
EDUSAT's telemetry in the form of voltages, currents, and temperatures are gathered on the MCU. This data is then sent via serial port to the client running on the connected computer. 

### Flashing the MCU
The MCU can be easily flashed using the Arduino IDE's built in tools or through VS Code's Arduino Extension. See this [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.vscode-arduino) for more information on the extension.

### Adding more sensors
The number of sensors being read is currently limited by the number of channels on the CD74HC4067 MUX ([link](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9056). Currently 16 sensors are used, the *SystemStatus* object keeps a list of the voltage, current, and temperature sensors. The size is set via the V_SENSE_SIZE, I_SENSE_SIZE, T_SENSE_SIZE parameters in SystemStatus.h.

### Using the MCU
Data from the sensors is updated via the SystemStatus's *updateStatus* function. Telemetry is then sent over the serial connection using the *sendTelemtry* function. Note that this data is sent in the following format:

* ```H,0-V,...,5-V,0-C,...,5-C,0-T,...,3-T,F```

Where the *V,C, and T* represent a integer voltage, current, or temperature. The H and F are used to denote the start and end of a individual message.

### Sensor Measurements
**Voltage Sensors**: Voltage sensing is achieved by simply connecting various points of the system to the pins of the MUX. Since the arduino is limited to 5V on its digital and analog pins some votlage dividers are used when measuring certain parts of the system. For example the 9V DC-DC output is measured and run through a voltage divider to ensure the pins of the Arduino are not damaged. The calculations to convert the reduced voltage back to the actual value at the test point are found below for each sensor in the circuit.

|Voltage Sensor Number | Gain|
| --- | --- |
| 0 & 1 | 1|
| 2 & 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 1.7 |
|5 | 2 |

Actual Voltage = Measured Voltage * Gain



**Current Sensors**: Current sensing is achieved using the MA4080 in series with various points throughout the system. Since the measured currents are sometimes small and the MAX4080 outputs a voltage equivalent to the measured current, ???? amplifiers are added between the current sensors and the MUX to allow for a more realiable measurement on-board the Arduino. The calculation to convert these measurements back to current is shown below.

[ADD Calculation]

**Temperature Sensors**: ???? thermistors are used to measure temperature at various points throughout the system. These are mechanically mounted on various IC's such as the LT3652 used in the MPPT system. The circuitry for the thermistors is very similar to that of the voltage dividers, as such the measured signal is fed directly into the MUX and small calculation is performed by the Arduino to convert the measured voltage to a temperature, as shown below.

R<sub>t</sub> = 10000 * (5/V - 1)

Temperature = (1 / ((1 / 298.15) + (log(R<sub>t</sub> / 2000) / 3500))) - 273.15

This above formula provides temperature in Celsius.

## EDUSAT Software - WebApp
EDUSAT's main interface is a web-client that can be viewed in any web browser and launched from any computer. In order to launch and open the app, follow the instructions below:

### Script Setup
In the main folder, there is a batch script (" .bat" extension). To run this script, simply double click the script file in your file explorer. If the computer that you are running on does not allow you run these scripts, follow the command line setup instructions below.

### Alternate Command line set up (to use if the bash script cannot execute)
1. Open up a command prompt
2. Navigate to the "EDUSAT_App" folder
3. Type the following command and press enter:  ```start cd serial && start cd socket_server && cd webpage```
5. Now there are three instances of command prompt running, one in each subfolder of the EDUSAT_App 
6. In the command prompt window in the ```serial``` subfolder, type the following commands, pressing enter after each command. Note: this may not work if you do not have an arduino connected, as an arduino is necessary for monitoring the system. For running the entire system, you must be connected to the onboard arduino.
    * ```yarn setup```
    * ```yarn build```
    * ```yarn start```
7. In the command prompt window in the ```socket_server``` subfolder, type the following commands, pressing enter after each command:
    * ```yarn setup```
    * ```yarn build```
    * ```yarn start```
8. In the command prompt windows in the ```webpage``` subfolder, type the following commands, pressing enter after each command:
    * ```yarn setup```
    * ```yarn serve```
9. In this command prompt as the previous step, you should see something similar to the following:
    * ```yarn run v1.22.4```
    * ```$ parcel serve --port 8085 src/index.html```
    * ``` Server running at http://localhost:8085```
10. In a web browser, go to the address on the last line, either by copying and pasting, or by clicking the address itself in your command prompt window

### Using the Web Client
After setting up the web client using either the bash script or the command line instructions provided aobve, you will be able to access the web-client through the web browser.

To select which data points are being graphed on each graph, toggle each dataset on and off by clicking on their legend entry.

To download the data into a csv:
* Click the "Prepare CSV" Button
* Click the "DOWNLOAD BUTTON" and a .csv file named with the current date and time will be downloaded to your computer. It will contain all data entries since the last time data was prepared and downloaded

### Closing the System
Once done with the system, it can be closed by pressing ```CTRL+C``` in each command prompt browser, followed by: ```y```  then ```ENTER``` when the command prompt asks if you wish to terminate the program.
